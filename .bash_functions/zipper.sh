Zip each folder or the contents of each folder within the current directory.

Usage:
  $ zipper -c              # Zip the contents of each folder (excluding the folder itself)
  $ zipper -i              # Zip each folder (including the folder itself)
  $ zipper -h              # Show this help message
  $ zipper                 # Same as -h

Notes:
  - All .zip files in the current directory will be removed before zipping.
  - Output files will be named after each folder (e.g., folder.zip).
  - Only top-level directories are processed.
